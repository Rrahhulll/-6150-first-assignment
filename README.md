Here's a summarized description of the tags used in your assignment:

This project demonstrates the use of various HTML tags to create a webpage with multimedia elements, forms, and interactive links.

In this assignment, the `<video>` and `<audio>` tags were used to embed multimedia files, both equipped with controls to allow user interaction (play, pause, volume adjustment) and autoplay to start playback automatically when the page loads. The `<img>` tag was used to display images, enhancing the visual aspect of the webpage. A `<form>` was included to collect user input, featuring elements like text fields, checkboxes, and buttons for a comprehensive interactive experience.

Additionally, `mailto:` within a hyperlink (`<a>`) was used to create a link that opens the userâ€™s default email client, allowing easy communication directly from the webpage. Hyperlinks were also used to connect to external pages, enhancing navigation. Overall, these tags combined to create a functional and engaging web page.

## IF REQUIRED
When cloning from GitHub, if you add a parent folder, include it in the `src` attribute before "/" to view the video, audio, and images. However, if you extract the zip file, there is no need to do that.
