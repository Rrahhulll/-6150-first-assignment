# First-assignment-6150

Here's a summarized description of the tags used in your assignment:

This project demonstrates the use of various HTML tags to create a webpage with multimedia elements, forms, and interactive links.

In this assignment, the <video> and <audio> tags were used to embed multimedia files, both equipped with controls to allow user interaction (play, pause, volume adjustment) and autoplay to start playback automatically when the page loads. The <img> tag was used to display images, enhancing the visual aspect of the webpage. A <form> was included to collect user input, featuring elements like text fields, checkboxes, and buttons for a comprehensive interactive experience.

Additionally, mailto: within a hyperlink (<a>) was used to create a link that opens the userâ€™s default email client, allowing easy communication directly from the webpage. Hyperlinks were also used to connect to external pages, enhancing navigation. Overall, these tags combined to create a functional and engaging web page.

#How to properly set up the link of the video, audio and img src:
When cloning from github, add the parent's folder name in the src before "/" in order to see the video, audio and img but if extracted the zip file there is no need to do that.
